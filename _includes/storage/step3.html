 <p><span  >Make sure one copy of your data is stored in a location with a different disaster threat than the others. For example, an institution facing earthquakes as the highest threat might store a copy in a geographic region where tornados, not earthquakes are the greatest threat. This practice is about reducing risk: could both copies face different disasters at the same time? While possible, it is highly unlikely. Like the step from level 1 to level 2, institutions will need to implement this in a way that works for them. Cloud vendors and participation in digital preservation networks are both options. Institutions could also agitate for an Alliance-wide storage solution.</span></p>
 
<p><span  >All storage systems will eventually become obsolete. Level 3 involves monitoring your system to be able to identify when the system is reaching the end of its lifespan. This does not necessarily have to be a complicated technical process: rely on your storage provider. For example, your IT department might know that a particular storage environment will need to be replaced within a certain timeframe. Document this so that you can follow up. If you rely on a cloud vendor, monitor the business so that if the vendor goes out of business, it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise. (reword)</span></p>
