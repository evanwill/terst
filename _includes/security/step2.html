<p>Some DAMS have the ability to provide different levels of access to content. For example, you might have materials that are made freely and openly available via the internet. You might also have some content that is restricted to authenticated users via Shibboleth or another identity solution. Still further, some material may be restricted to only on-campus, or on-premises use. Lastly, some content may not be intended to be accessible by anyone other than Library staff. This could consist of high-quality digital master files, archival materials that need to be redacted for privacy or security concerns before use, and others.

Documenting these access restrictions, while the restrictions themselves are often enforced by current computer systems, is important to consider because current reasons for such restrictions might not always be so obvious. Documenting these decisions and the reasons behind them allows someone in the future to interpret the decision, understand the reasoning, and potentially adopt a change if necessary. </p>
