<p>It is important to maintain a record of what happens to files in order to provide both provenance and continuity. Digital files are very easy to change, and keeping track of what changes have been made can help maintain the integrity of a set of files.

Lightweight examples might include: noting how images are scanned and manipulated in post-processing and including de-duplication notes in a finding aid for a digital collection.

<p>Again, maintaining a record of changes can be made easier by choosing a DAMS that allows for this sort of logging. Some logs might also be kept by the system administrators and a conversation can help you understand if and how this information is collected. Using a tool like Archivematica to process and manage your preservation master files can help keep track of preservation actions. </p>
