<span>This website is meant to assist those responsible for digital preservation activities at their respective institutions to assess and improve their practices in various digital preservation areas. We uses the National Digital Stewardship Alliance’s</span> [<span>Levels of Digital Preservation</span>](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/NDSA_Levels_Archiving_2013.pdf) <span>and the CCD Digital Preservation Working Group’s</span> [<span>own report</span>](https://www.orbiscascade.org/file_viewer.php?id=4169) <span>assessing the Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries’ alignment with those levels as a baseline for instruction.</span>

## <span>Instructions</span>

<span>You will first need an assessment of the digital preservation practices at your institution. You can do this yourself, by going through each of the NDSA’s five categories -- Storage and Geographic Location; File Fixity and Data Integrity; Information Security; Metadata; and File Formats -- and assigning your institution a level for each, from 0 to 4\. Alternatively, if you or someone from your institution filled out our survey in the Spring of 2016 (

), you may also contact Devin Becker (</span>[<span>dbecker@uidaho.edu</span>](mailto:dbecker@uidaho.edu)<span>) to receive our (admittedly subjective) assessment.</span>

Once you have your assessment, you can go directly to any of or our sections to determine which steps you might be able to take to improve your digital preservation practices in one of the five areas. Simply take your score from that section, and then go to the subsection on how to move from your level to the next. For example, if you are at Level 1 for Information Security, you would go to the section titled  “Level 1 → Level 2.” In that subsection, you will find instructions, links to resources, and specific steps that will help you improve your practices in that area.

<span>One note: often an institution may be doing a variety of digital preservation actions that might be greater than or less than their assigned level. It’s advised that when doing this exercise, participants also look at levels previous to where they are assigned to make sure they’re fulfilling those steps as well.  </span>
